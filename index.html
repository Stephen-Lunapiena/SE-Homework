            <p id="paragraph1"> Hi, I am Steve, and welcome to my first demo page. I am very excited to be taking on this new project of software development, so allow me to introduce myself- because I never would have expected to be here. From a young age I was always interested in the arts. I spent many years studying music and playing instruments. My main instrument was the guitar, but have also played many others. As well, I have also play in many bands since high school. Later on in life, around the age of 20, I also studied dance. Though I tried many different styles, I mostly focused on Ballet and Modern. Those had the most appeal to me due to the sheer technique involved as well as the choreography that I saw. In my years of dancing, because I generally performed in multiple pieces during each performance or showcase. I really enjoyed the process of choreographing, perfecting technique, rehearsing, and performing. It was around this time that I also picked up an interest in strength training and powerlifting and have been doing that for several years. <br> <br> Professionally, I have worked in the Wine and Spirits industry for over a decade. This is the <a href="https://www.getwineonline.com" target="blank">first company</a> I was employed at. It is also where I learned the ins and outs of the business how to taste wine. With all of that being said, it has been incredibly hard to balance all these hobbies/passions within my life, while making a living. Thus, I would also add mental and emotional wellness as something I have spent a lot of time in developing and LOVE talking about. The bottom line is, I love connecting with people. Regardless of how serious or not you consider these things, I love bringing people together. This is ultimately why I want to delve into software development. I want to help make or develop technologgy to create a bigger impact in people's lives. <br> <br><br><br> Though, not an extensive list, I am particularly excited in developing projects that are related to the following areas:
