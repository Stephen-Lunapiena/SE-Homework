<p>I've been working in the wine industry for over a decade. I became my manager's protoge when I was about 20 years old. At first, I didn't have any interest in wine, but as I began trying many different types, I began to appreciate it. One of the most frequent questions I get asked is "how do I learn about wine?" It takes a lot of repition and studying, just like anything else. Note-taking was my best friend!
